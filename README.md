# JS30 Update CSS Variables #
My finished project is deployed [HERE](https://cbarber1984.github.io/js30-CSS-Variables/)

## Objective ##
- Use vanilla JavaScript to create a page with control elements that dynamically alter display attributes

## Key Learning ##
- Variables definied at the `:root` level can be used throughout the CSS document
- The `data` attribute can be added to page elements for use in other areas (i.e. adding 'px' as a `data-sizing` attribute so that 'px' can be added later when updating a spacing variable)
